v1.0.2: July 11th 2016
- Fixed ExecuteBefore
- Fixed VideoFrame not being properly released


v1.0.1: July 10th 2016
- Tested multi-threading and error handling. Both are working fine.
- Renamed the new Finalize function to ExecuteAfter.
- Added ExecuteBefore function with CancelLoad parameter.
- If CancelLoad is specified during ExecuteBefore, the filter will be discarded and other filters can be executed instead.
- env.Invoke can now take null as arguments parameters.
- Added generation of intellisense documentation.
- Fixed env2.GetProperty by adding managed enumeration.
- Added InterProcessNet sample which performs a frame operation in a different process.

Known issues:
- ExecuteBefore result will be ignored; calling SetChild with its result causes an infinite loop with SetCacheHints
- LoadPluginNet must point to a path known to the assembly (same folder) or it may not recognize the DLL
